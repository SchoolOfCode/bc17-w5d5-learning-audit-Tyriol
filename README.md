# My Learning Audit

## What is this all about?

Pause, Reflect, Plan then Take Action 
Review how things are going each week<br>
Highlight using RAG which areas I feel good about, so so, or not strong enough<br>
Make a plan to improve on three of the items listed

## How I'm going to do it?

As I feel like I might need general polishing in all areas, I will try and turn this into a simple express app!
Let's see how it goes.
