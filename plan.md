## The problem

- Make a list containing a list item for each Course Module you've done so far (On-boarding, Software, Frontend, Backend, Database).
- For each item (Course Module) make a sub list containing the things we asked you to learn that week.
- Next to each sub list item give yourself a confidence rating of (Green, Orange or Red). 
- Now prioritise and pick 3 items to take action on (self-study / practice).
- Now learn and practice.

## The plan

1. Setup starter files for the front end (HTML, CSS, JS) ✅
2. Setup backend files for an express app
    1. Initialise a node project ✅
    2. Create an app.js file ✅
    3. Install express ✅
    4. Install helmet ✅
    5. Install the logging tool ✅
    6. Add a `.gitignore` file with node_modules ✅
3. Setup backend files for database interactions
    1. Create an index.js for db interaction ✅
    2. Install the pg npm package ✅
    3. Create a reset-database file ✅
4. Design the front-end (whiteboard)
    1. Header ✅
    2. Input for Course Module ✅
    3. Input for things we've been asked to learn ✅
        1. With a way to link it to course Module ✅
        2. And a way to mark it Red, Amber or Green ✅
    4. Display for each course module with it's associated list ✅
    5. BONUS: A way to select 3 to focus on.
5. Flesh out HTML using following flow:
    1. User adds a course 
    2. User adds a learning linked to that course
    3. User assigns it a RAG value
    4. User views a list of courses and their learnings
